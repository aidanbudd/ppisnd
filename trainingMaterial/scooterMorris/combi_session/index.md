### Network visualization of proteomics data

For this practical we will use data from the paper ["Temporal proteomics of NGF-TrkA signaling identifies an inhibitory role for the E3 ligase Cbl-b in neuroblastoma cell differentiation"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25921289). Specifically, we will use [Supplementary Table S3](Table_S3.xlsx).

If you have another suitable dataset yourself, you are of course welcome to use that instead.
