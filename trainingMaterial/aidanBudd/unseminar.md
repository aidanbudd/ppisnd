# First Budapest Unseminar in Bioinformatics (BUB1)


An “Unseminar” is a participant-driven meeting, a shorter version of an “[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)” . The content and structure of the events is driven by you!
Unlike offering yet-another-seminar (yuck!), an unseminar offers interactivity amongst all participants.

We've been running more than twenty unseminars as part of
[HUB - Heidelberg Unseminars in Bioinformatics](http://www.hub-hub.de/#pastevents) which is a registered Club (gemeinnütziger eingetragener Verein in Heidelberg) aiming at fostering communication between scientists in the natural sciences.

Here's the website for [BUP1](http://www.hub-hub.de/wordpress/?tribe_events=bub1-tools-you-dont-want-to-be-without-anymore), and here's a more detailled [plan](http://www.hub-hub.de/wiki/index.php?title=BUB1) of the evening...
